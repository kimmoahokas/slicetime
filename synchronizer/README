This folder will contain the synchronizing component that runs in the priliged domain of Xen

The component will support a server mode and a client mode:

In the server mode, this program acts as a sychronization server that synchronizes clients using
the barrier algorithm. The clients can be local Xen Guests, remote Xen Guests scheduled by a remote xen-sychronizer
running in client mode or simulation clients themselves. Local guests, however, are directy managed by the server
through hypercalls or syscalls (?) and they are directly registered at the server.

In client mode, the xen-synchronizer registers as at a xen server using a communication protocol specified
/communication based on UDP. Clients run either in a synchronized or unsynchronized mode. Within the synchronized mode,
the xen-synchronizer client waits for the the server to permit guests to run for a certain amount of time, after which
execution is suspended. The server is notified afterwards.
